### **1. Homepage Hero (30 seconds)**
*Load homepage, scroll through hero*

Educators can identify bullying incidents before they escalate.

Complete privacy - no accounts, no storage, no surveillance."

### **3. Instagram Reel Frame Extraction (60 seconds) 🌟**
*Click URL tab, paste: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRsSB5zjN9M/*

"Now our industry-leading feature - no competitor does this.

We download the actual Instagram reel video, extract key frames from the first, middle, and last seconds using FFmpeg, then analyze the VISUAL content - not just the caption."

*While loading, continue:*

"Traditional tools only read captions. We analyze what's actually IN the video.
This catches threats hidden in visual content - inappropriate imagery, dangerous behaviors, concerning symbols."

"Here - 3 frames extracted, 30-second duration detected, comprehensive visual threat analysis.

This is a game-changer for child safety."

We offer a free tier for acquisition, premium features for retention.

Clear path to $1M+ annual revenue with B2C families and B2B school contracts."
