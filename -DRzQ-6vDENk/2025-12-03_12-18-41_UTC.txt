During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Donald Trump’s press briefings often turned into unpredictable television moments. In one June 2020 interview, he stopped the conversation in the Oval Office to ask an aide who coughed to leave the room, saying it was inappropriate during such a serious discussion. The spontaneous reaction, combined with the tense atmosphere, made the scene feel more like a comedy segment than a presidential interview.
